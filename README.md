# FlaUI

### Introduction
FlaUI is a .Net library which helps with automated UI testing of Windows applications (Win32, WinForms, WPF, Store Apps, ...).<br />
It is based on the newest native UI Automation Library from Microsoft to support all cutting-edge technologies.<br />
FlaUI wraps almost everything from the UI Automation Library but also provides the native objects in case someone has a special need which is not covered (yet).<br />
FlaUI implements it's own wrapper around the native UIA Library. Some ideas are copied from the project UIAComWrapper and Teststack.White but rewritten from scratch to have a clean codebase.
